        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Aarush</strong> — a Full Stack Developer with a passion for building robust, scalable, and user-friendly web
            applications. I specialize in crafting seamless frontends with <strong>Angular</strong> and powering them with solid backends
            using <strong>Spring Boot</strong>.</p>
        <p>What drives me is the challenge of turning complex ideas into elegant, efficient solutions. I enjoy working
            across the full stack — from designing responsive UI components to developing secure RESTful APIs and
            integrating them into smooth, end-to-end systems.</p>
        <p>Beyond coding, I’m always exploring new tools, best practices, and architectural patterns to sharpen my
            skills and stay ahead of the curve. I value clean code, meaningful design, and technology that serves a
            purpose.</p>
        <p>This portfolio is a glimpse into what I’ve been building and learning. I'm excited about the future and all
            the possibilities that come with writing good code and solving real-world problems.</p>
